## TODO
- make plugin manager more minimal
- make website with just an html file and css file
- add some plugins/themes/completions potentially as repos
- need simple function for updating plugins
- add links to different plugins on the site or readme, get people out of the oh-my-zsh borg

suggestions and contributors welcome
